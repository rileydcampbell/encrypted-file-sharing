# encrypted-file-sharing
Implemented a file sharing system similar to dropbox that provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for all users.
Designed a security scheme with the use of Google’s UUID library and GoLang’s RSA cryptographic functions.
Successfully demonstrated fundamental security principles in our design document that led our team to finish in the top 5% of students by protecting against all of the possible malicious security attacks designed by Professor Nick Weaver at UC Berkeley.
